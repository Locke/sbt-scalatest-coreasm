# TODO

* un-fork `TestEngineDriver.java` once a CoreASM version is published to maven that contains [#26](https://github.com/CoreASM/coreasm.core/pull/26) (specifically [53e4979](https://github.com/CoreASM/coreasm.core/commit/53e4979) and [cf7010d](https://github.com/CoreASM/coreasm.core/commit/cf7010d))
* maybe checkstyle
* maybe contributing rules
* publish a stable version, e.g. to maven central
